  This program essentially does the same thing as ex1.ae, but to a higher
  precision by using left and right shifts.

N0 4000000000
N1    2500000
N2   28000000

  Multiply 4,000,000,000 by 2,500,000.

*
L0
L1

  Shift the result down by six decimal places.

>6
S3

  Divide that number by

/
L3
<6
L2

  Store the quotient (from the prime egress axis) and print it.

S4'
P

  Store the remainder (from the main egress axis) and print it.

S5
P
