          <p class="lead">A Java simulation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_Engine">Analytical Engine</a>, a mechanical computer devised by Charles Babbage in the mid-1800s but never built.

          <p>The original source code for this package was written
          by <a href="//www.fourmilab.ch">John Walker</a>, and is available
          from <a href="//www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/contents.html">this
          website</a>. That software is in the public domain, according to
          <a href="//www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/cmdline.html">this website</a>.

          <p>This package is distributed under the terms of the GNU General
          Public License version 3.

          <h4>Getting the simulator</h4>

          <p>The source code for the Analytical Engine simulator is available
          from <a href="//github.com/jfinkels/analyticalengine">GitHub</a>.

          <pre class="command-line"><span class="command">git clone https://github.com/jfinkels/analyticalengine</span></pre>

          <h4>Building from source</h4>

          <p>This project uses <a href="//maven.apache.org/">Maven</a> for
          build management and requires Java 1.7 to compile.

          <p>To create a shell script that runs the simulator, run

          <pre class="command-line"><span class="command">mvn package appassembler:assemble</span></pre>

          <p>This produces a script that executes the simulator
          at <code>target/appassembler/bin/analyticalengine</code>.

          <p>For more information, visit the <a href="//github.com/jfinkels/analyticalengine">GitHub page</a>.

          <h4>Running an Analytical Engine program</h4>

          <pre class="command-line"><span class="command">analyticalengine myprogram.ae</span></pre>

          <h4>Programming the Analytical Engine</h4>

          <p>The programming language for this machine is arcane, but
          relatively similar to modern machine languages. For more information
          on the instruction set and how to write programs for this machine,
          see <a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/cards.html">this
          website</a>.

          <p>Each instruction is called a "card", since the original Analytical
          Engine would have programmed with punched cards.

          <div class="ae-example">
            <p>Store the number 123 in memory location 1.
            <pre>N1 123</pre>
          </div>
          <div class="ae-example">
            <p>Lines beginning with a space or a period are comments. A period
            after another instruction indicates a comment.
            <pre>
   This program does foo and bar.

            <p>The <code>P</code> instruction does not print directly to
            standard output; the attendant receives all printed strings and
            makes them all available at once after the program has terminated.

  Address 0 is the current value of n.
  Address 1 is the accumulator for the cumulative product.
  Address 2 represents the constant 1.
